This Project is based on Optical Character Recognition using pytesseract and Speech Recognition Library. In this project the user passes a black and white image with text written over it and then we extract the text from the image and by using speech recognition we can make computer read it for us.

# Modules Used -
1. pytesseract - Python module used for Optical Character Recognition
2. pyttsx3 - Python module for converting text to speech
3. cv2 - Open Computer Vison library in python 

# Installations -
